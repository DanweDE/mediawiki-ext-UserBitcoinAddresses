# mediawiki-ext-UserBitcoinAddresses
MediaWiki extension for having users manage their Bitcoin addresses usable for multiple purposes but 
without any specific purpose implemented or suggested by this extension itself.

The main feature of the extension is its `Special:UserBitcoinAddresses` special page which allows 
each registered wiki user to associate Bitcoin addresses with him or herself. Other users can not
see those addresses by default. Other extensions might use these user related Bitcoin addresses
for various purposes.
